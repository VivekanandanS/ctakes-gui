# ctakes-gui
Dictionary Creator downloaded from http://ctakes.apache.org doesn't work expected , so I made this as seperate stand-alone. Eventhough gui-res.jar contained files required by Dictionary Builder , it kept throwing missing resource required . This codebase is contains dictionary builder and resource required . I hope somebody facing the same issue can make use of this .
